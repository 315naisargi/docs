<p>Hi, I'm Max. I'm a software engineer based in the UK and I love what I do. If you want me to do something for you, get in touch by sending me an email at <a href="mailto:work@maxgoodridge.com">work@maxgoodridge.com</a>. See who you could work with on my <a href="http://youtube.maxgoodridge.com">YouTube channel</a> and read my <a href="http://www.maxgoodridge.com">personal website</a> for more information. You can also see my work on <a href="github.com/maxg203">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p><em>Prices listed are per hour unless otherwise stated.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Static Website <strong><em>£25</em></strong></p>

        <p>This includes anything like a blog, personal website, small business website redesigns and anything else that does not require many complexities usually associated with websites. Static sites are powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, where content is written in markdown and can easily be read, understood and maintained by anyone well after the core development process has finished.</</li>

    <li><p>Full Stack Web Development <strong><em>£45</em></strong></p>

        <p>This service includes anything up to and including the most powerful, state of the art websites like social networks, corporate software products and more. Nothing is impossible with this package. This means complex database architecture, powerful deployment streamlining and optimisation, all the way through to a beautiful, interactive front end experience leveraging the best current web technologies.</p></li>

    <li><p>Hybrid Mobile App <strong><em>£35</em></strong></p>

        <p>If you have the next brilliant app idea but have no idea where to start, then you are in the right place. By building a Hybrid app, you do not have to develop seperately for iOS and Android. Instead, we can work on a single, beautiful and intuitive mobile app using Ionic, Angular and Cordova.</p></li>

    <li><p>Conference <em><strong>£85</strong> for the day</em></p>

        <p>I will give a talk at your conference or corporate events. Areas of specialism include <em>Streamlining the Django Deployment</em>, <em>Writing Pythonic Code</em>, <em>Finding the Best Employees</em> and <em>The Programming Mindset</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> I <em>frequently</em> have to decline clients simply due to supply and demand. I should also mention that rates are only increasing. Thank you for your interest.</p>
