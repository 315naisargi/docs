Whether you already have Python installed or not, you can go to [python.org](https://python.org) in order to get the latest version and follow the installation process for your respoective operating system as prompted.

On your computer, you should now have a new program called IDLE (which stands for Integrated DeveLopment Environment). Open this and you should now have a place to enter valid Python code and have it interpreted line by line by what is known as the [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) interpreter. This is the most standardised and widely used implementation of Python.
