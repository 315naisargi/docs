There is a little issue when we register a new user that, although a new user does register successfully, that user is not logged in automatically.

When you go to the registration form, fill it in and submit it the first problem
we hit is that there is a misconfigured URL namespace in `accounts/views.py`
that prevents newly registered user from being able to access the home page. On
line 20, where we redirect the user to the home page, change the redirect URL to
`reverse('home:home')` which uses the `home` namespace instead of the `accounts`
namespace that it was previously (we moved the home view since this code was written).
